    "### What is it?\n",
    "A prefix is essentially a string that is prepended to a model's response, rather than to the user's query. This means that the model will not generate the string, but it will be included as part of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we ask a model a question:\n",
    " - Input: `User: Hi there! Assistant:`\n",
    " - Output: `Hello! It's nice to meet you. Is there something you'd like to talk about or learn more about? I'm here to help.`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we want the model to always start with \"I'm kind\" for a specific use case and continue from there as a completion model, it would look like this:\n",
    " - Input: `User: Hi there! Assistant: I'm kind`\n",
    " - Output: ` and new here, so please bear with me if I make any mistakes. How can I assist you today?`\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we can force the model to begin a sentence or response with a desired string of our choice!"
