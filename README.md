# GitHub Models

Welcome to your shiny new Codespace for interacting with GitHub Models! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with the what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub yet. If and when you’re ready you can click "Publish Branch" and we’ll create your repository and push up your project. If you were just exploring then and have no further need for this code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.

## Getting Started

There are a few basic examples that are ready for you to run. You can find them in the [samples directory](/samples/README.md). If you want to jump straight to your favorite language, you can find the examples in the following directories:
- [JavaScript](/samples/js/README.md)
- [Python](/samples/python/README.md)
- [REST](/samples/curl/README.md)

If you are already familiar with the GitHub Models service, you can start by running our Cookbook examples. You can find them in the [cookbooks directory](/cookbooks/README.md). Here are the direct links to the available languages:
- [Python](/cookbooks/python/README.md)
